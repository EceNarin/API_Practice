3. Using Digest Authentication
Even though this is also considered a “weak” authentication method, using Digest Authentication represents an advantage over the basic protocol.

This is due to the fact that this scheme avoids sending the password in cleartext.

Despite this difference, implementing this form of authentication with REST Assured is very similar to the one we followed in the previous section:

given().auth()
  .digest("user1", "user1Pass")
  .when()
  // ...
Note that, currently, the library supports only challenged authentication for this scheme, so we can't use preemptive() as we did earlier.
